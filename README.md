# Subtitler

Thid is an application to aid in the creation of subtitles for video content. It does this via the video's creator uploading the audio track of their video 

It creates a transcript of the audio as an .srt file, and explains to the user how to add timestamps and recommends correcting any mistakes in the transcript.
